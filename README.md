# Ibiclou

Ibiclou helps you find free bikes around you and see where you can take one or drop one off.

We use react-native with [expo.io](https://expo.io) to build Ibiclou, you can open it with the expo app: https://expo.io/@leopradel/ibiclou.

Ibiclou uses the CityBikes API to display the stations. You can find it [here](https://api.citybik.es/).
